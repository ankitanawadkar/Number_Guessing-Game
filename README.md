# Number_Guessing-Game
 I developed a Number Guessing Game using Java. This project challenges users to guess a randomly generated number within a given range. I implemented essential Java concepts such as loops, conditional statements, and methods to manage user input, provide feedback on guesses, and track the number of attempts. The game offers a user-friendly experience by indicating whether the guess is too high or too low, and concludes by displaying the number of attempts taken once the correct number is guessed. This project showcases my understanding of Java fundamentals, including logic control and user interaction.
